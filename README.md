**Stop manually organizing your documents. Let AI do it.**

You've got a Paperless-ngx instance. You've got hundreds (thousands?) of documents. You *know* you should tag them, set correspondents, organize them properly. But who has time for that?

PaperlessMCP connects your Paperless-ngx to any MCP-compatible AI. Now instead of clicking through the UI, you just ask:

> "Find all my tax documents from 2023"
>
> "Tag these 50 invoices as 'Business Expense' and set the correspondent to 'Acme Corp'"
>
> "Upload this receipt and figure out what it is"
>
> "What documents am I missing from my insurance folder?"

It's Paperless-ngx on LLM steroids. An interface designed *specifically* for AI to manage your documents while you do literally anything else.

## What Can AI Do With Your Paperless?

Everything. Full CRUD on every entity type:

| You Say | AI Does |
|---------|---------|
| "Find receipts from Amazon over $100" | Searches documents with filters |
| "Tag all 2024 invoices as 'Tax Year 2024'" | Bulk updates dozens of docs at once |
| "Upload this PDF and file it appropriately" | Uploads, auto-tags, sets correspondent |
| "Delete all documents tagged 'Junk'" | Removes with confirmation (dry-run by default) |
| "Create a tag for medical records, make it red" | Creates tag with color |
| "Who sends me the most documents?" | Lists correspondents by document count |
| "Set up a storage path for legal documents" | Creates organized folder structure |

**43 tools** covering:
- **Documents** — search, upload, download, update, delete, bulk operations, OCR reprocessing
- **Tags** — full CRUD with colors and matching rules
- **Correspondents** — track who sends you stuff
- **Document Types** — classify invoices, receipts, contracts, whatever
- **Storage Paths** — organize files with smart templates
- **Custom Fields** — add your own metadata (dates, amounts, URLs, etc.)

All destructive operations require explicit confirmation and default to dry-run mode. AI can't nuke your archive by accident.

## Is PaperlessMCP Right For You?

**Yes, if:**

- You run Paperless-ngx (self-hosted or cloud)
- You use any AI assistant that speaks MCP (Claude, or anything else supporting the protocol)
- You have a backlog of untagged documents and feel guilty about it
- You'd rather say "organize this" than click 47 buttons
- You want to query your documents in plain English
- You think computers should work for you, not the other way around

**No, if:**

- You don't use Paperless-ngx (this isn't a general document tool)
- You enjoy manually tagging documents (weirdo, but respect)
- You don't trust AI with your files (fair, but you can dry-run everything first)

**The sweet spot:** You've got Paperless running, you've got an MCP-compatible AI, and you want them to be friends.

## Getting Started

### You'll Need

1. **A Paperless-ngx instance** with an API token
   *(Settings → Django Admin → Tokens → Create one for your user)*

2. **An MCP-compatible AI** (Claude Desktop, or anything speaking the protocol)

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The fastest path from zero to talking to your documents.

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/barryw/PaperlessMCP?label=latest)](https://github.com/barryw/PaperlessMCP/releases/latest)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name paperless-mcp \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e PAPERLESS_BASE_URL=https://your-paperless.example.com \
  -e PAPERLESS_API_TOKEN=your-token-here \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  ghcr.io/barryw/paperlessmcp:vX.Y.Z
```

> **Grab the version from the badge above.** We don't use `latest` because [you deserve reproducible deployments](https://vsupalov.com/docker-latest-tag/).

Connect your MCP client to `http://localhost:5000/mcp` and start talking to your documents.

### Option 2: Claude Desktop

Add to your config file:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paperless": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "/path/to/PaperlessMCP/PaperlessMCP", "--", "--stdio"],
      "env": {
        "PAPERLESS_BASE_URL": "https://your-paperless.example.com",
        "PAPERLESS_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Look for the tools icon — Paperless should be there.

### Option 3: Kubernetes

For the homelabbers running k8s. We include ready-to-use manifests with Kustomize support.

```bash
# Clone and customize
git clone https://github.com/barryw/PaperlessMCP.git
cd PaperlessMCP/k8s

# Create your secrets
kubectl create secret generic paperless-mcp \
  --from-literal=PAPERLESS_BASE_URL=https://your-paperless.example.com

kubectl create secret generic paperless-token \
  --from-literal=token=your-api-token-here

# Deploy (edit the image tag first)
kubectl apply -k .
```

[See the manifests](k8s/)

Includes: Deployment, Service, Ingress, Kustomization. Tweak to taste.

### Option 4: From Source

For contributors and tinkerers:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barryw/PaperlessMCP.git
cd PaperlessMCP
dotnet run --project PaperlessMCP             # HTTP/SSE on :5000
dotnet run --project PaperlessMCP -- --stdio  # stdio mode
```

Requires [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0).

## Contributing

Yes please. We use trunk-based development with conventional commits.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barryw/PaperlessMCP.git
cd PaperlessMCP
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

**The rules:**
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.) — versions bump automatically
- Tests pass or it doesn't merge
- Destructive operations need `confirm=true` and dry-run by default

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full rundown.
